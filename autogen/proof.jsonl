{"name": "additive_cancellation", "description": "If a + c = b + c, then a = b", "proof": "Based on the documentation, here's the proof of the problem \"If a + c = b + c, then a = b\" in Litex:\n\n```litex\n# Proof that if a + c = b + c, then a = b\n\nlet a R, b R, c R:\n    a + c = b + c\n\n# Subtract c from both sides\na + c - c = b + c - c\n\n# Simplify using additive inverse\na + (c - c) = b + (c - c)\na + 0 = b + 0\n\n# Simplify using additive identity\na = b\n```\n\nThis proof follows the basic algebraic steps:\n1. We start by declaring the objects a, b, c as real numbers with the given equation a + c = b + c\n2. We subtract c from both sides of the equation\n3. We use the additive inverse property (c - c = 0)\n4. We use the additive identity property (a + 0 = a and b + 0 = b)\n5. This leaves us with the desired conclusion that a = b\n\nThe proof uses basic arithmetic properties that are built into Litex's number system, as shown in the documentation examples where basic algebraic manipulations are performed."}

The base case handles n=0, and the inductive step shows that if the statement holds for some k, it must also hold for k+1. The proof uses basic properties of exponents and fractions that should be built into the Litex system.\n\nThe proof is wrapped in the required code block format with ````litex` and demonstrates how to use induction in Litex to prove a statement about exponents of fractions."}

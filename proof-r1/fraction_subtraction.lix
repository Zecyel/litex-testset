# a/b - c/d = (ad - bc)/(bd) for b,d â‰  0

let a R, b R, c R, d R:
    b != 0
    d != 0

# Express fractions using multiplicative inverses
a/b = a * (1/b)
c/d = c * (1/d)

# Common denominator b*d
=:
    a/b - c/d
    a * (1/b) - c * (1/d)
    (a * d) * (1/(b*d)) - (c * b) * (1/(b*d))   # Multiply first term by d/d, second by b/b
    (a*d - c*b) / (b*d)   # Combine numerators

# Commutativity of multiplication
know forall x R, y R:
    x * y = y * x

# Apply commutativity to numerator
=:
    (a*d - c*b) / (b*d)
    (a*d - b*c) / (b*d)   # Since c*b = b*c
    (ad - bc) / (bd)       # Conventional notation without *

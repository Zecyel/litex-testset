# If a/b = c/d then a×d = b×c for b,d ≠ 0

let a R, b R, c R, d R:
    b != 0
    d != 0
    a / b = c / d

# Multiply both sides by b*d (nonzero)
(a / b) * (b * d) = (c / d) * (b * d)

# Left side simplifies to a*d
=:
    (a / b) * (b * d)
    a * (1 / b) * b * d
    a * 1 * d
    a * d

# Right side simplifies to c*b
=:
    (c / d) * (b * d)
    c * (1 / d) * d * b
    c * 1 * b
    c * b

# Since multiplication is commutative
c * b = b * c

# Therefore
a * d = b * c

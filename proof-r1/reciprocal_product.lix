# For a,b ≠ 0: 1/(a×b) = (1/a)×(1/b)

let a, b R:
    a != 0
    b != 0

# Show that (a×b)×((1/a)×(1/b)) = 1
(a * b) * ((1/a) * (1/b)) = a * b * (1/a) * (1/b)   # Associativity
= a * (1/a) * b * (1/b)   # Commutativity
= (a * (1/a)) * (b * (1/b))   # Associativity
= 1 * 1   # Inverse property
= 1   # Identity property

# Since (a×b)×((1/a)×(1/b)) = 1, by definition of multiplicative inverse:
1/(a*b) = (1/a)*(1/b)

# If a > b, then a + c > b + c for any c

let a R, b R, c R:
    a > b

# By the definition of >, a - b > 0
a - b > 0

# Rearrange the expression (a + c) - (b + c)
(a + c) - (b + c) = a + c - b - c
a + c - b - c = a - b + (c - c)
a - b + (c - c) = a - b + 0
a - b + 0 = a - b

# Thus (a + c) - (b + c) = a - b > 0
(a + c) - (b + c) > 0

# Therefore a + c > b + c by definition of >
a + c > b + c

# Sum of even and odd integer is odd

prop even(n Z): exist k Z: n = 2 * k
prop odd(n Z): exist k Z: n = 2 * k + 1

let a Z: $even(a)
let b Z: $odd(b)

have k Z st $even(a)  # Witness for a being even
have m Z st $odd(b)   # Witness for b being odd

a = 2 * k
b = 2 * m + 1

a + b = 2 * k + (2 * m + 1)
a + b = 2 * (k + m) + 1

let s = k + m  # s is integer since k,m âˆˆ Z
s $in Z

exist s st $odd(a + b)  # Prove sum is odd by witness

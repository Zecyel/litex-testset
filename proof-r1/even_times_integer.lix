# Product of even integer with any integer is even

let m Z, even integer:  # m is an even integer
    exist k Z: m = 2 * k  # Definition of even integer

let n Z  # n is any integer

# Compute the product m*n
m * n = (2 * k) * n  # Substitute m with 2k
= 2 * (k * n)  # Associative property of multiplication

# Let l = k * n, which is an integer since Z is closed under multiplication
have l Z := k * n

# Then m*n = 2*l, which is even by definition
m * n = 2 * l

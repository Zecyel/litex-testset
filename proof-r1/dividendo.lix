# If a/b = c/d then (a-b)/b = (c-d)/d for b,d â‰  0

let a R, b R, c R, d R:
    b != 0
    d != 0
    a / b = c / d

# Expand both sides of the equation
(a - b) / b = a/b - b/b
(c - d) / d = c/d - d/d

# Simplify b/b and d/d
b/b = 1
d/d = 1

# Substitute simplifications
(a - b)/b = a/b - 1
(c - d)/d = c/d - 1

# Use given equality
a/b - 1 = c/d - 1

# Conclude equality
(a - b)/b = (c - d)/d

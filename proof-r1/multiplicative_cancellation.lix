# If a × c = b × c and c ≠ 0, then a = b

let a R, b R, c R:
    a * c = b * c
    c != 0

# Subtract b*c from both sides
a * c - b * c = b * c - b * c
a * c - b * c = 0

# Factor out c
(a - b) * c = 0

# Apply zero product property
or:
    a - b = 0
    c = 0

# We know c ≠ 0, so a - b must be 0
know c != 0
then:
    a - b = 0

# Therefore a = b
a = b

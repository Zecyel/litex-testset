# a/b = (a÷c)/(b÷c) for c ≠ 0

let a R, b R, c R:
    c != 0

# Left side: a/b
a / b

# Right side: (a÷c)/(b÷c)
(a / c) / (b / c)

# Simplify denominator (b/c) by multiplying numerator and denominator by c
= (a / c) * (c / b)

# Cancel c terms
= (a * c) / (c * b)

# Commutative property of multiplication
= (a * c) / (b * c)

# Cancel c terms (since c ≠ 0)
= a / b

# Therefore, a/b = (a÷c)/(b÷c) when c ≠ 0
a / b = (a / c) / (b / c)

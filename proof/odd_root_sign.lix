# For odd n, âˆš[n]{a^n} = a

# Proof that for odd n, the nth root of a^n equals a

let n N:
    n % 2 = 1  # n is odd

let a R

# Define the nth root function
fn nth_root(x R, n N) R:
    nth_root(x, n)^n = x

# Main proof
claim:
    nth_root(a^n, n) = a
    prove:
        # Since n is odd, the nth root function is bijective on R
        # Therefore, the only solution to x^n = a^n is x = a
        nth_root(a^n, n)^n = a^n  # by definition of nth_root
        (nth_root(a^n, n))^n = a^n
        # For odd n, x^n = y^n implies x = y
        nth_root(a^n, n) = a

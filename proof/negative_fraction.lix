# -a/b = (-a)/b = a/(-b)

let a R, b R:
    b != 0

# Proof that -a/b = (-a)/b
-a/b = (-1 * a)/b  # by definition of negation
     = (-1) * (a/b)  # by distributive property of division
     = (-a)/b  # by definition of negation

# Proof that (-a)/b = a/(-b)
(-a)/b = (-1 * a)/b  # by definition of negation
       = -1 * (a/b)  # by distributive property of division
       = a/(-b)  # since dividing by -b is same as multiplying by -1/b

# Therefore, -a/b = (-a)/b = a/(-b)
-a/b = (-a)/b = a/(-b)

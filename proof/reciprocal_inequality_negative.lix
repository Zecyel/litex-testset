# If a < b < 0, then 1/a < 1/b < 0

let a R, b R:
    a < b
    b < 0

# First prove 1/a < 1/b
# Since a < b < 0, both a and b are negative
# Multiply both sides of a < b by 1/(ab) (which is positive since a,b < 0)
a * (1/(ab)) < b * (1/(ab))
1/b < 1/a
1/a > 1/b

# Now prove 1/b < 0
# Since b < 0, dividing both sides by b (a negative number) reverses the inequality
1 > 0
# Which is equivalent to
1/b < 0

# Combining both results
1/a > 1/b
1/b < 0
=:
    1/a < 1/b < 0

# For even n, âˆš[n]{a^n} = |a|

# First, we define the nth root function
fn nth_root(x R, n N_pos) R:
    x >= 0 or n % 2 = 0  # For even n, x can be negative
    then:
        nth_root(x, n)^n = x

# Define absolute value function
fn abs(x R) R:
    x >= 0 => abs(x) = x
    x < 0 => abs(x) = -x

# Main proof
let n N:
    n % 2 = 0  # n is even
let a R

# Case 1: a >= 0
prove:
    a >= 0
    nth_root(a^n, n)^n = a^n  # By definition of nth_root
    nth_root(a^n, n) = a       # Since a >= 0 and n is even
    abs(a) = a                 # By definition of abs
    nth_root(a^n, n) = abs(a)

# Case 2: a < 0
prove:
    a < 0
    nth_root(a^n, n)^n = a^n   # By definition of nth_root
    a^n = (-a)^n               # Since n is even
    nth_root(a^n, n) = -a      # Taking nth root
    abs(a) = -a                # By definition of abs
    nth_root(a^n, n) = abs(a)

# Combining both cases
forall a R:
    or:
        a >= 0
        a < 0
    then:
        nth_root(a^n, n) = abs(a)

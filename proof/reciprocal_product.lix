# For a,b ≠ 0: 1/(a×b) = (1/a)×(1/b)

let a R, b R:
    a != 0
    b != 0

# Start with the left side
1 / (a * b)

# Multiply numerator and denominator by (1/a * 1/b)
= (1 * (1/a * 1/b)) / (a * b * (1/a * 1/b))

# Simplify numerator
= (1/a * 1/b) / (a * b * (1/a * 1/b))

# Simplify denominator: a * (1/a) = 1 and b * (1/b) = 1
= (1/a * 1/b) / (1 * 1)

# Final simplification
= (1/a) * (1/b)

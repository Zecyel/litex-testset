# If A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A, then A = B

let A set, B set

# Given A is a subset of B
know forall x A:
    x $in B

# Given B is a subset of A
know forall x B:
    x $in A

# To prove A = B, we need to show:
# 1. Every element of A is in B (already given)
# 2. Every element of B is in A (already given)

# Therefore A = B by definition of set equality
A = B

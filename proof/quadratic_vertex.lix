# Vertex of axÂ²+bx+c is at x = -b/(2a)

let a R, b R, c R:
    a != 0

# The vertex form of a quadratic function is f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex
# To find the vertex, we'll complete the square

# Start with the standard form
f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c

# Factor out 'a' from the first two terms
= a*(x^2 + (b/a)*x) + c

# Complete the square inside the parentheses
= a*(x^2 + (b/a)*x + (b/(2a))^2 - (b/(2a))^2) + c

# Rewrite as perfect square plus remaining terms
= a*((x + b/(2a))^2 - (b/(2a))^2) + c

# Distribute 'a'
= a*(x + b/(2a))^2 - a*(b/(2a))^2 + c

# Simplify the constant terms
= a*(x + b/(2a))^2 - (b^2)/(4a) + c

# Now in vertex form: f(x) = a*(x - h)^2 + k where h = -b/(2a) and k = c - (b^2)/(4a)
# Therefore, the vertex is at x = -b/(2a)

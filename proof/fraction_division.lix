# (a/b) ÷ (c/d) = (a/b) × (d/c) for b,c,d ≠ 0

let a R, b R, c R, d R:
    b != 0
    c != 0
    d != 0

# First, express division as multiplication by reciprocal
(a/b) ÷ (c/d) = (a/b) × (1/(c/d))

# Simplify 1/(c/d) to d/c
1/(c/d) = d/c

# Substitute back
(a/b) × (1/(c/d)) = (a/b) × (d/c)

# Therefore
(a/b) ÷ (c/d) = (a/b) × (d/c)

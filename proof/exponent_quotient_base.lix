# (a/b)^n = a^n / b^n for b â‰  0

let a R, b R:
    b != 0
let n N

# Proof by induction on n
prove_by_math_induction:
    # Base case: n = 0
    (a/b)^0 = 1
    a^0 / b^0 = 1 / 1 = 1
    (a/b)^0 = a^0 / b^0

    # Inductive step
    assume (a/b)^k = a^k / b^k holds for some k >= 0
    then for k+1:
    (a/b)^(k+1) = (a/b)^k * (a/b)     # by definition of exponentiation
               = (a^k / b^k) * (a/b)  # by inductive hypothesis
               = (a^k * a) / (b^k * b) # by fraction multiplication
               = a^(k+1) / b^(k+1)    # by definition of exponentiation

# Therefore, by induction, the statement holds for all n in N
forall n N:
    (a/b)^n = a^n / b^n

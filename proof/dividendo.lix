# If a/b = c/d then (a-b)/b = (c-d)/d for b,d ≠ 0

let a R, b R, c R, d R:
    b != 0
    d != 0
    a / b = c / d

# Multiply both sides by b*d to eliminate denominators
a / b * (b * d) = c / d * (b * d)
a * d = c * b

# Subtract b*d from both sides
a * d - b * d = c * b - b * d
(a - b) * d = (c - d) * b

# Divide both sides by b*d (which is allowed since b,d ≠ 0)
(a - b) * d / (b * d) = (c - d) * b / (b * d)
(a - b) / b = (c - d) / d

# |a + b + c| â‰¤ |a| + |b| + |c|

# Proof of the triangle inequality for three real numbers

# First, we need the basic properties of absolute value
know forall x R:
    |x| >= 0
    |x| = x if x >= 0 else -x

# The standard triangle inequality for two numbers is built-in
know forall x R, y R:
    |x + y| <= |x| + |y|

# Now prove the three-number version
let a R, b R, c R

# Apply the two-number version twice
|a + b + c| = |(a + b) + c| <= |a + b| + |c|  # First application
|a + b| <= |a| + |b|                          # Second application

# Combine the inequalities
|a + b + c| <= |a + b| + |c| <= (|a| + |b|) + |c| = |a| + |b| + |c|

# Therefore, |a + b + c| <= |a| + |b| + |c|

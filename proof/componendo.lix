# If a/b = c/d then (a+b)/b = (c+d)/d for b,d â‰  0

let a R, b R, c R, d R:
    b != 0
    d != 0
    a / b = c / d

# Multiply both sides by b
a = (c / d) * b

# Add b to both sides
a + b = (c / d) * b + b

# Factor out b on the right side
a + b = b * (c / d + 1)

# Divide both sides by b
(a + b) / b = c / d + 1

# Similarly, add d to both sides of the original equation
c + d = (a / b) * d + d

# Factor out d on the right side
c + d = d * (a / b + 1)

# Divide both sides by d
(c + d) / d = a / b + 1

# Since a/b = c/d, we can substitute
(a + b) / b = (c + d) / d

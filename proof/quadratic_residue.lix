# a is quadratic residue mod p if x² ≡ a mod p has solution

# Definition of quadratic residue
prop quadratic_residue(a Z, p Z):
    dom:
        p > 1
    iff:
        exist x Z:
            x^2 ≡ a mod p

# Example proof that 4 is a quadratic residue modulo 5
know:
    exist 3 Z:
        3^2 ≡ 4 mod 5
    $quadratic_residue(4, 5)
